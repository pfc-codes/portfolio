## Overview
I supervised and executed VFX for a short music video, focusing on scan-based environments
and procedural effects that could be iterated quickly during post.

## What I did
- Captured environment scans for use in CG
- Built a reusable Geometry Nodes system for point cloud effects
- Delivered comp-ready renders for editorial

## Notes
This project was designed to be lightweight, modular, and adaptable for future videos.
